### Description
   You have a weighted tree whoes root is number 0, the tree doesn't have any loops, and you can reach all the vertexes from 0. All the value of the edges are between 1 and 2000000 inclusive. You have to find a solution that reach each vertex at least once and has the minimal cost, the cost is the total of the edge values you have pass. There are 50 vertexes at most.

### Algorithm
We konw that we should get through each edge twice except the path you get through the last, so we can add all the edges twice first, support the value is v, then, we can find a path from the root to the leaf node that have the biggest weight and get the value of it, support it's t, the answer is the v-t, because if the edge is not in the path we get through the last, we have to go through it twice, and the last path we go through we **only** need go ghrough **once**
