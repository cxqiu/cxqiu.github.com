###Description###
Give you three numbers a, b and c. you should tell me that if there has any solutions let a plus c numbers is bigger than b, the numbers you add to a are in {1, 2, 3}.

###Algorithm###
1. Sol.1

	You could enumerate the number of 1, 2 and 3, if 1*(number of 1)+ 2*(number of 2) + 3*(number of 3) is not less than the number wo need, we add fac(n)/(fac(number of 1)*fac(number of 2) * fac(number of 3)) to the answer. we only need to enumerate two variable so the third can get from n-n1-n2(n is the number we need, n1 is the first number we enumerate, n2 is the seconde number we enumerate). So the Time complexity is O(n^2), and n equals to b - a

		for i=1 to c
			for j=1 to c-i
				k = c-i-j
				if(i+2*j+3*k>=n)
					ans = ans + f[n]/(f[i]*f[j]*f[k])

2. Sol.2

	we use a two dimensions vector `f[i][j]` to store the solutions we have see the previous i numbers and the numbers' sum equals to j. In this way, we have `f[i][j]` = `f[i-1][j-1]+f[i-1][j-2]+f[i-1][j-3]`, and the numbers are all only used once. So, we could pretreatment the f vector, and use the vector to calculate the answer, we and `f[c][b-a+1]+f[c][b-a]+...+f[c][3*c]` is the value we want, because if a number t puls a is bigger than b, we have tis bigger than b-a, the upper boundary is calculated by the numbers are all 3, in that way, we will have the upper boundary 3*c

		memset(f,0,sizeof(f))
		f[0][0] = 1
		for i=1 to 100
			for j=1 to 3*i
				for k=max(0,j-3) to j-1
					f[i][j] += f[i][k]
				
		for i = b-a+1 to 3*c
			ans += f[c][i]
