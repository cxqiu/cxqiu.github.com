###Description###
250-points: Give you some strings, you should return the most frequent letters in the strings.

500-points: Give you a number n, you should return the smallest number r, r is bigger than n and has the same number of 1 with n in binary.

1000-points: Give you a Matrix m hold the relationship of boys and girls and a number K, if `m[i][j] == 1` then boy i can be paired with girl j, and 0 otherwise. You should return the number of distinct valid ways to select exactly K boy-girl pairs.

###Algorithm###
250-points: Just go through the strings and count eache letter's count, return the most frequent of them.

500-points: First, you should get the number of 1 in n's binary, then find the rightest(the right is the low bit) bit with 1 in n's binary, and keep going until a bit with 0 in n's binary, then replace the 0 with 1 and put the other 1s in the rightest. For example, n=47 with binary 101110, first we find the rightest 1 in n's binary, we got the second bit from the right, and keep going until a bit with 0 in n's binary, we got the fifth bit from the right, so we replace the 0 with 1, now, we get a number in binary 111110, the number of 1s in this number in binary is more than 47, so we put another two 1in 110000, because 110000 guarantee the number we get is bigger than n, in this case, we only to put anoter two 1 in the rightest of 110000, so we can get the smallest number. There is a nice way to get the rightest 1 in n : `n&-n`, you can view the details in [there](http://www.cppblog.com/klion/archive/2010/05/24/116240.html). We can also use permutation to solve this problme, keep the number n in binary, and calculate this binary number's next permutation, in the end, we get the decimal value of the binary number which is we want

1000-points: In the first sight, I think this is a search problme, and write the code blow:
	
	void search(int n, in k) // n is the boy we search now, k is the pairs we still need
		{
			if(k<1)	//there are already K(the pairs we need) pairs
				{
					++ret;  //ret is the answer we want to get
					return ;		
				}
			if(n>=R)	//boys are all searched
				return ;
			if(k>R-n+1) // the last boys and girls can't satisfy the K condition
				return ;
			int t[10];
			search(n+1, k);	//this boy is not in any pairs
			for(int j=0;j<C;++j)	//C is the number of girls
			{
				if(dance[n][j] == 1)
				{
					for(int i=0;i<R;++i)
					{
						t[i] = dance[i][j];
						dance[i][j] = 0;
					}
					search(n+1, k-1);//this boy is paired with girl j
					for(int i=0;i<R;++i)
						dance[i][j] = t[i];
				}
			}
		}

but Time-Limit-Exceed in the case has 10 boys and 10 girls, and each boy can be paired with each girl, the K equals to 10. In these cases matrix items are all 1, we could use the formula `fac[R]*fac[C]/(fac[R-K]*fac[C-K]*fac[K])` to calculate the answer, but this is a trick way, if there is only a 1 in the matrix, this way can't work.
we could use another search strategy: define the search function like this: 

	search(int boys, int validgirls, int couples);//boys is the boy index
	you search now, validgirls is the girls we still don't used (one girl
	uses one bit) and couples is the couples we still nedd.
and keep each state value if we calculate it as dp algorithm, this will save a lot of time. The code of this algorithm is blew:

	int search(in boys, int validgirls, int couples)
	{
		int cnt = __builtin_popcount(validgirls);	//get how many girls don't be paired with boys
		if(couples > cnt || couples > boys) //ther are to less boys or girls to satisfy the couples count
			return 0;
		if(0 == couples)
			return 1;
		if(f[boys][validgirls][couples]>=0)//we have calculate it already
			return f[boys][validgirls][couples];
		int ret = search(boys-1,validgirls,couples);//this boy doesn't be paired with any girls
		for(int i=0;i<C;++i)	//searh each girl
			{
				if('Y' == canDance[boys-1][i])//if this boy can be paired with girl i
					{
						if(validgirls & (1<<i))//if this girl doesn't be paired with any other boys
							{
								ret += search(boys-1, validgirls^(1<<i),couples-1);
							}
					}
			}
		f[boys][validgirls][couples] = ret;//set this state answer as calculated
		return ret;
    }
In other way, we also use dp algorithm to calculate this problem, the state of the problem is `dp[i][j]` is that we have seen the first i boys and j is the girls be paired with any boys, the code is below:
    
    memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp)); //initialize the vector 
    dp[0][0] = 1;   
    R = canDance.size(); //R is the number of boys
    C = canDance[0].length();//C is the number of girls
    for(int i=1;i<=R;++i)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<(1<<C);++j)
                {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];//this boy doesn't be paired with any girls
                    for(int k=0;k<C;++k)
                        {//enumerate every girl
                            if((j&(1<<k)) && ('Y' == canDance[i-1][k]))//if girl k doesn't be paired with any other boys and can be paired with boy i-1;
                                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j^(1<<k)];
                        }
                }
                        }
                }
        }
    ret = 0;
    for(int i=1;i<(1<<C);++i)
        {//if K girls are paired with boys
            if(__builtin_popcount(i) == K)
                ret += dp[R][i];
        }
    return ret;
