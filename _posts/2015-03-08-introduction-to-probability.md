##Chapter 1
The set of possible outcomes is called the *sample space*. First of all, we define the elements of a sample space to be outcomes. Seconde, each subset of a sample space is defined to be an *event*.  

Definition 1.4 If $P(E) = p$, the *odds* in favor of the event $E$ occurring are $r:s$(r to s) where $r/s = p/(1-p)$. If $$r$$ and $s$ are given, then $p$ can be found by using the equation $p=r/(r+s)$.
